"Keep me fully glad..."
Keep me fully glad with nothing. Only take my hand in your hand.<br>
In the gloom of the deepening night take up my heart and play with it as you list. Bind me close to you with nothing.<br>
I will spread myself out at your feet and lie still. Under this clouded sky I will meet silence with silence.<br> I will become one with the night clasping the earth in my breast.
Make my life glad with nothing.<br?
The rains sweep the sky from end to end. Jasmines in the wet untamable wind revel in their own perfume.<br> The cloud-hidden stars thrill in secret. Let me fill to the full my heart with nothing but my own depth of joy.<br>
- by Rabindranath Tagore
